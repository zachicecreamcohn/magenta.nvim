# Sandboxes

- we should patch sandbox runtime some more to allow projects to further customize their setup. I haven't been able to get puppeteer tests against localhost to work through the sandbox for example (though running in docker works, thankfully).
- sandboxes on osx still trip up when running sandbox tests... seems like node phones home intermittently? Why?

# Prompt tuning

- the agent is still prone to re-read the file (even force-re-read) before making further edits... maybe we jsut drop the context.md "this file is in your context already" round trip. Also, maybe _reading_ is just a lot cheaper than _generating_ so we could think about having edl send the full edited section back. Something like "the file now reads <full contents of edited section of file>"
- system reminder should tell the agent not to "acknowledge" the reminder
- try trimming things down in general...

# token efficiency

- Let's revisit how we summarize files.
- summarize large files even when they're pulled in via contextFiles

# customization

- look for context.md files and skills all the way up the dir chain, not just in cwd

# docker

- we're still referencing some files from the host, which the agent can't actually read

# UX

- scrolling. When we send a message, we should scroll the user input to the top (as currently), but then put the cursor on the last line of the buffer (Streaming...), so it scrolls down as the text grows
- Animate the dot on "streaming" independent of partial stream results
- when a thread is titled, we should use that title somehow in the buffer name (instead of just using an opaque id, though still need to make sure it's unique)
- make the spawn_subagents preview the command as it's streaming in
- thread display buffers should be listed
- deleting a thread display or input buffer (via :bd) should remove that thread from magenta state
- = on spawn_subagents is showing "\n" ... we should probably format that more nicely
- let's make = vs <CR> more consistent. "=" should always toggle expand. "<CR>" should always "enter / select". We should always have the carrot to visually indicate that the section is expandable
- when the list of edited files gets long, collapse it to a "N edited files" summary + carrot
- trim the stream display (for edl especially) to the last N lines, so it doesn't collapse down and mess with scroll when it finishes.
- tmux integration (update tab title with active thread title, thread state)
- toggling sandbox to off should auto-approve any current dialogues

# misc features

- fork a conversation from any previous message. Also get rid of @fork - let's just make fork a Magenta command or a message binding (so it doesn't interact with sendMessage)
  - we should be able to @fork during the assistant's turn, tool use, etc... without aborting the thread we're in
- add context tracking for the state of git. When we change branches, commit, etc...
- asking aside/followup questions about things is a bit awkward... it would be cool to allow one to select a part of the display buffer, and then ask a question about it, with the output appearing within the flow of the original thread
- support for oil buffers for adding files to context
- enable thinking summary

# bug fixes, etc

- when we abort during a "sandbox blocked" message, it stays up even as the conversation continues
  - this has broken a few times already, make sure we have a good test for it
- thread overview and other thread buffers not showing up in the buffer list
- revisit the buffer handling. Keep getting stuck in buffer not matching the file state
  - try to write buffer before agent reads, but read from the disk with warning even if it doesn't work
  - try to read buffer after agent writes, but let the agent write to the file and surface a warning even if it doesn't work
- when we error upon a user message send, we should pop the user message off the agent's history, otherwise we end up sending it twice
- this periodic error:

```
[ERROR] job# 3:
[Thread 019d65c4-5c0a-70bb-9882-732030e3427c] myUpdate: tool-progress
```

- overloaded handling / exponential backoff not working correctly
- when we terminate/error, the reset for the message places it in the wrong buffer (currently open one, not the one corresponding to the thread that the error happened in)
- figure out why bedrock is not doing thinking now
