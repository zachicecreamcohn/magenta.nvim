# Creating Skills for magenta.nvim

This guide explains how to create custom skills that extend Claude's capabilities in magenta.nvim.

## Skill Locations

Skills can be placed in two locations:

### Global Skills

- **Location**: `~/.magenta/skills/`
- **Usage**: Available across all projects
- **Use case**: General-purpose skills you want in every project

### Project-Specific Skills

- **Location**: `.magenta/skills/` (in your project root)
- **Usage**: Only available in that specific project
- **Use case**: Project-specific workflows, conventions, or documentation

## Skill Structure

Each skill lives in its own subdirectory with a `skill.md` file:

```
~/.magenta/skills/
└── your-skill-name/
    ├── skill.md          # Required: main skill documentation
    └── scripts/          # Optional: executable scripts
        └── helper.ts     # Optional: TypeScript scripts
```

## skill.md Format

The `skill.md` file must include YAML frontmatter with required fields:

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# Your Skill Documentation

Write your skill documentation here in markdown format.

This can include:

- Detailed explanations
- Code examples
- Best practices
- Step-by-step instructions
- References to other files or resources
```

### Required Frontmatter Fields

- **name**: Unique identifier for the skill (lowercase with hyphens recommended)
- **description**: Short description that gives the agent some hints as to the content of the full skill.md file.

## TypeScript Scripts in Skills

Skills can include executable TypeScript scripts using `tsx` for execution.

### Setup

Install TypeScript and tsx in your skill directory:

```bash
cd ~/.magenta/skills/your-skill-name  # or .magenta/skills/your-skill-name
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev typescript tsx
```

### Creating a Script

1. Create a `scripts/` directory in your skill folder
2. Add a `.ts` file:

```typescript
// Your TypeScript code here
console.log("Hello from a skill script!");

// You can use TypeScript features directly
interface Config {
  name: string;
  value: number;
}

const config: Config = {
  name: "example",
  value: 42,
};

console.log(config);
```

4. Run it with tsx:

```bash
cd ~/.magenta/skills/your-skill-name && npx tsx scripts/your-script.ts
```

### Running Shell Commands with zx

For scripts that need to run shell commands, use Google's `zx` library:

```bash
npm install --save-dev zx
```

### Script Requirements

- **TypeScript**: Install via npm in the skill directory
- **tsx**: Install via npm for TypeScript execution
- **zx** (optional): Install for shell command execution
